# Sort Visualizer

## Overview

Sort Visualizer is an interactive web application built using React that visually demonstrates various sorting algorithms. This tool is designed to help users understand how different sorting algorithms work through dynamic, step-by-step animations.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch sorting algorithms in action with real-time animations.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Choose from a range of sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, and more.
- **Customizable Speed**: Adjust the speed of the animations with a drop-down menu offering options like 1x, 2x, and 3x.
- **Educational Tool**: Ideal for students, educators, and anyone interested in learning about sorting algorithms.
